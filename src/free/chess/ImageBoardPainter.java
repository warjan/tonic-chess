   * idea. If you don't, all the squares will look about the same. Since in the

   * Loads the board images from the specified URL. The structure at the

   * That file should contain the following two properties:
   * <ul>
   *   <li><code>type</code>: The value is either "single" or "light-dark". This
   *       specifies whether there is a single image of the entire board or two
   *       pattern images for the light and dark squares. If this is omitted,
   *       "light-dark" is assumed.
   *   <li><code>image.type</code>: Specifies the extension (type) of the
   *       image(s) - gif, png, etc. If this is omitted, "gif" is assumed.
   * </ul>
   * If the value of <code>type</code> is "single", the image will be loaded
   * from a file named "board.gif" (assuming <code>image.type</code> is "gif").
   * If the value of <code>type</code> is "light-dark", the images will be
   * loaded from "light.gif" and "dark.gif". In this case, the definition file
   * must contain the boolean property <code>scaleSquares</code>. This property
   * specifies whether the square images specify an exact image of each square
   * or a general pattern to be used for the squares. In effect, if the value
   * of <code>scaleSquares</code> is "true", the light and dark square images
   * will be stretched to fill each square on the board. If it is "false", the
   * images will be sliced and tiled to fill each square. The default value is
   * "false". In the first case all the squares will look the same - in the 2nd
   * they may not look the same if the patterns are bigger than the squares. If
   * all your desired values are the default ones, you may omit the definition
   * file altogether.
