  The event subtypes selection specifies which of the subtypes of the chosen
event type your script will "respond" to. If the selected event type has no
subtypes, then no checkboxes will appear and your script will be run whenever an
event of the chosen type occurs. You can find the documentation of the various
subtypes at http://www.jinchess.com/docs/scripter/ (first specify the chess
server you're using, then click on the event type you selected).
