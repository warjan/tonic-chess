To compile Tonic, you will need to get Jakarta Ant from
http://ant.apache.org/. Once you've downloaded and installed it,
simply type "ant" in the directory where the build.xml file is. This will first
compile Tonic, putting all the compiled classes in a newly created "classes"
directory and then package it up, making it ready to run in the "build"
directory. You can then run Tonic by changing into the "build" directory and
running "java -jar tonic.jar" (or the tonic script if you're on unix).
