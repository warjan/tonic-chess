*********** Install Java ***********
************************************

1. Check whether you already hava Java installed by typing "java -version" at
   the commandline.
   IMPORTANT: The result should not say something about "gcj" or "kaffe". If
   it does, what you have is an incomplete Java implementation which cannot
   run Jin. You will need to install a good version.
2. If you don't, Install one of the following Java Runtime Environments:
   * Linux - Download and install one of the following 
     * IBM's 1.4 - 
       http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/linux140/?dwzone=java.
     * Blackdown: http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux.html
     * Sun's 1.4 - http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/download.html
     * You can also try Sun's 1.5-beta release, which has many improvements
       (including UI responsiveness), and is reasonably stable in my
       experience. You can find it on http://java.sun.com.

   * FreeBSD - Download the latest Java version from
       http://www.freebsd.org/java/

   * Solaris - Usually Java comes preinstalled, but if it isn't, you can get one
       from http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/download.html.

   * For other systems, I suggest a websearch for a 1.4 compatible JVM.


***********************************
*********** Install Jin ***********
***********************************

1. Extract the tar.gz file you downloaded into some directory (if you got this
   file from the tar.gz file, then you're done :-)).

3. Make sure that the "java" binary is in your PATH. If you have one of the
   latest versions of Java installed, that will usually already be the case.
   Type "java -version" in a shell to see whether it works and to find the
   version of Java you have.
   If you don't have it in your PATH and don't know how to add it, ask on a
   newsgroup, #linuxnewbies on IRC, channel 212 on ICC or channel 85 on FICS.

4. Change to the jin directory (this will usually be in the format
   jin-<version> (jin-2.11 for example) and run Jin with "./jin". You can also
   create a symlink to the jin script in your ~/bin directory. If the jin script
   doesn't work for you for some reason, you can also run Jin with
   "java -jar jin.jar" from Jin's directory (the last part is important).

5. See http://www.jinchess.com/faq for information on setting your BROWSER
   variable. Setting it properly allows Jin to open URLs when you click them in
   your preferred browser. You can set this variable in the "jin" script.

6. If you encounter any bugs, want to ask for a certain feature or ask any 
   general question about Jin, see the sourceforge project page at
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/jin/ or email me directly at
   msasha@engineer.com.

7. Enjoy! (or Profit!!!) :-)

*********** Notes ***********
*****************************

* Almost all desktop useable operating systems have Java 1.2 or later for them,
  so this readme file will now assume you have that. If nevertheless you want
  to run Jin under Java 1.1, please contact me for instructions at
  msasha@engineer.com.
